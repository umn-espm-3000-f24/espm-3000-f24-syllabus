# Preface {.unnumbered}

> ### **"In this damaged and troubled but persistent world, frozen earth will continue to shape and be shaped by humans...Frozen earth will also surprise us, for better and for worse. It will be studied, learned from, lived with, and perhaps mourned, but neither saved nor conquered."**
