This will be done in “jigsaw” style - you will be responsible for becoming familiar with 1 paper per week, while using an AI tool (CHatGPT or Claude) as a co-pilot while completing a worksheet to engage with and understand your paper. You will then share your understanding of your paper with your small group, who will take summary notes - there will be 6 members per group.

Your small group and letter will remain the same throughout the semester. Aside from Week 1 and Week 14 (the last week), you will be assigned a peer-reviewed paper, which will be available on Canvas to read and summarize while engaging with AI tools. Papers will be posted on Canvas one week ahead of time. Each week, you will be required to submit a summary worksheet (which will be available as a template) for your paper. This will require you to read the paper and engage with AI tools to summarize, clarify and ask questions of the paper. The summary worksheet is due on Thursdays (the day before Friday class) by 11:59PM on Canvas.\nGroup Jigsaw Worksheet\nDuring each class session, you will spend time with your small group sharing brief summaries and discussing each of the assigned papers. During this small group time, you will complete a Group Jigsaw Worksheet to be submitted at the end of class - the worksheet will ask you to take condensed notes on each of the 6 assigned papers. This worksheet will be submitted at the end of class on Fridays - on Canvas for the Zoom session and as a hard copy (hard copies will be provided at the beginning of class) for the in-person section.\nDuring the final class session (December 6th), you will share with your small group a synthesis product (see below). You will complete a group jigsaw worksheet for sharing these synthesis products as well.\nSynthesis Product: Final Figure or Text Critique\nDuring the final class session, you will share with your small group one of two choices of synthesis assignment that you have completed. You can either: - 1) Create a figure that synthesizes or provides information on a permafrost-related topic we have discussed or - 2) You can critique an article (choices will be provided) addressing a permafrost-related topic from a popular news source. This assignment will be due on the last day of class (December 6th).",

Your grade will not be determined by a percentage (%) grade, instead it will be determined by your capacity to meet the requirements of a particular grade level. Final course grades use the +/- system of grading. Course grades will be assigned using the following criteria, which is based on the UMN Grading and Transcripts Policy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nCriteria\n\n\n\n\nA\nOne or fewer unexcused absences; Completion of all Assigned Paper Summaries at a satisfactory level or higher (11); Completion of all Group Jigsaw Worksheets at a satisfactory level or higher (12); Completion of Synthesis Product at a satisfactory level or higher (1)\n\n\nA-\nMeets the requirements of the A Grade in 3 of the 4 criteria\n\n\nB+\nMeets the requirements of B grade, and also meets the requirements of the A grade in 2 of the 4 criteria\n\n\nB\nTwo or fewer unexcused absences; Two or fewer Assigned Paper Summaries at a lower than acceptable level (11); Two or fewer Group Jigsaw Worksheets at a lower than acceptable level (12); Completion of Synthesis Product at a satisfactory level or higher (1)\n\n\nB-\nMeets the requirements of B Grade in 2 of the 4 criteria.\n\n\nC+\nMeets the requirements of C Grade, and also meets the requirements of the B Grade in 1 of the 4 criteria.\n\n\nC\nThree or fewer unexcused absences; Three or fewer Assigned Paper Summaries at a lower than acceptable level (11); Three or fewer Group Jigsaw Worksheets at a lower than acceptable level (12); Completion of Synthesis Product at a lower than acceptable level (1)\n\n\nC-\nMeets the requirements of C Grade in 2 of the 4 criteria.\n\n\nD+\nMeets the requirements of D Grade, and also meets the requirements of the C Grade in 1 of the 4 criteria.\n\n\nD\nFour or fewer unexcused absences; Four or fewer Assigned Paper Summaries at a lower than acceptable level (11); Four or fewer Group Jigsaw Worksheets at a lower than acceptable level (12); Completion of Synthesis Product at a lower than acceptable level (1)\n\n\nF\nFailing to meet the minimum requirements of the D grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA grade of C- is required to pass this class if you elected to take this course under the Pass/Fail grading system.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Grade Assignments\nGrades will be assigned by criteria as described on this page. No curve will be applied. I do not oblige requests for grade “bump-ups” for extra credit at the end off the semester as these requests are not fair to your fellow students and against University policy. Be proud of the grade you earned!\n\n\n2.2.3 Grading Challenges\nAny challenges to graded assignments you wish to be considered should be emailed to the Nic and Katrina within one week of the posting date of the graded item.\n\n\n2.2.4 Student Workload Statement\nThis course conforms to the UMN expected time per course credit policy. Per that policy:\n\nFor all academic sessions, courses, and modalities, hours of instructional time for a course must equal at least the number of credits for the course times 15 weeks in an academic term. 1 credits x 1 hour in class per credit x 15 weeks = 15 hours of instructional time\nOne credit equals 3 hours of work per week (both in and out of class). So, a 1 credit class equals 1 credits x 3 hours/credit = 3 hours per week. 1 credits x 3 hours per week x 15 weeks = 45 hours total\n\nHere is how the course conforms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\nNumber\nHours\n\n\n\n\nClass Sessions (including in-class Group Jigsaw Worksheets)*\n14\n14 x 1 = 14 hours\n\n\nAssigned Paper Summaries\n13\n13 x 2 = 26 hours\n\n\nSynthesis Product\n1\n5 x 1 = 5 hours\n\n\n\nIN CLASS*\n14 hours\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n45 hours",

The Disability Resource Center is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities in any form to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attention, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical), please contact DRC at 612-626-1333 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. If you are registered with DRC and have a current letter requesting reasonable accommodations, please contact your instructor as early in the semester as possible to discuss how the accommodations will be applied in the course.",

These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you. In addition to campus-wide mental health resources, the CFANS Wellness Navigator, Rose Simon, is available to meet the needs of students as it relates to personal well-being for any reason. If you are interested in meeting with Rose, her webpage shares a bit more about the ways that you can get connected.",

Within the scope and content of the course as defined by the instructor, it includes the freedom to discuss relevant matters in the classroom. Along with this freedom comes responsibility. Students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled. Reports of concerns about academic freedom are taken seriously, and there are individuals and offices available for help. Contact the instructor, the Department Head, your academic advisor, the CFANS Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Faculty Affairs, or the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs in the Office of the Provost.",

However, broadly disseminating class notes beyond the classroom community or accepting compensation for taking and distributing classroom notes undermines instructor interests in their intellectual work product while not substantially furthering instructor and student interests in effective learning. Such actions violate shared norms and standards of the academic community.",

    "text": "5.10 Scholastic Dishonesty\nYou are expected to do your own academic work and cite sources as necessary. Failing to do so is scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. (see Student Conduct Code Section 5.2). If it is determined that a student has cheated, they may be given an “F” or an “N” for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University.\nThe Office for Community Standards provides a wealth of information on the Student Conduct Code and Scholastic Dishonesty. If you have additional questions, please clarify with your instructor for the course. Your instructor can respond to your specific questions regarding what would constitute scholastic dishonesty in the context of a particular class-e.g., whether collaboration on assignments is permitted, requirements and methods for citing sources, if electronic aids are permitted or prohibited during an exam.",
